This an API client module that is used to consume data from API Gateway. This client was developed to address the need
of processing millions of rows of data from AWS Athena without hitting API Gateway and Lambda resource limit.
Usage:
    set your api request parameters as dictionary
    usage_request = {"service_start": "2021-03-01","service_end": "2021-03-06","page_size": 1000}
    call the function
    usage = get_usage(usage_request)
    process your usage as desired
    print(usage)
